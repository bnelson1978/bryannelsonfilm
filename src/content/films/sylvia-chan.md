Sylvia Chan is a writer, educator, a foster youth advocate, and author of We Remain Traditional (Center for Literary Publishing, 2018).  Chan has received fellowships from the Poetry Foundation, Zoeglossia, Bolt Cutters, and The Center for Art and Advocacy’s Right of Return. Her poem “Monster in Martyr” explores both the violence and possibilities of renewal in foster youth experiences. This piece is part of a collaboration with the University of Arizona Poetry Center.
