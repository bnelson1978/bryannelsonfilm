The Guinness World Record for developing the world’s fastest electron microscope now belongs to the University of Arizona, thanks to breakthroughs made by Associate Professor of Physics and Optical Sciences, Mohammed Hassan. The microscope is so fast that it can match the speed of electrons in motion, meaning that it can resolve clear images of these subatomic particles in real time and space. Soon researchers might be able to use the microscope to better understand the mysterious realm of quantum mechanics.
