Founded in 1893, Arizona State Museum at the University of Arizona is the oldest and largest anthropological research facility in the U.S. Southwest. It is also Arizona’s official archaeological repository, housing more than 3 million cataloged objects, and growing by as much as 1,000 cubic feet of bulk material every year. Three separate collections are especially prized (pottery, basketry, photography), designated as American Treasures by the U.S. government, which underscores the museum’s vital importance to the nation's shared cultural history.
