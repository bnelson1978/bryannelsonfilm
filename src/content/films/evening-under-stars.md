Twice a year, the Tucson Amateur Astronomy Association opens up their exclusive Chiricahua Astronomy Complex to the public for an “evening under the stars” – a remarkable opportunity for the local community to get a look at the night sky in detail they may never have seen before. The complex sits within a designated Dark Sky area, where the band of the Milky Way shimmers as it parades across the sky, inspiring wows and wonders from star gazers.
