Poet Gabriel Dozal reads his poem “No Pares, Sigue, Sigue” from his larger collection of poems, titled "The Border Simulator." The collection tells stories of a brother and sister, named Primitivo and Primitiva, who are attempting to cross the US-Mexico border in search of a better life. The poems are all written in both English and Spanish and explore the idea of the border as both a real place and a living simulation. This was done as part of a video poetry series in collaboration with the University of Arizona Poetry Center.
