When thinking of premiere wine grape-growing regions around the world, Arizona rarely comes to mind. That’s because grape farming in Arizona sits right on the edge of what’s possible with viticulture. There are heat waves, vine-cracking winter frosts, and most extreme of all: monsoons during the harvest season that can transform the chemistry of wine grapes overnight. But Arizona winemakers are resilient, and the state’s wine industry is booming. There’s a unique terroir you can taste, with a palate unlike any other.
