The Campus Agricultural Center is a 160 acre farm right in the middle of Tucson that operates as a research and teaching facility for the University of Arizona’s College of Veterinary Medicine. It includes extensive pasture land for its horses, cows, and sheep, which are affectionately cared for by a team of veterinarians and staff. The animals, often referred to as “pasture professors,” are able to give veterinary students invaluable hands-on experience working with large agricultural animals, something not many other programs are able to offer.
