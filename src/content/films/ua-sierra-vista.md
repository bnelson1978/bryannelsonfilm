The University of Arizona’s College of Applied Science & Technology (CAST) is the primary department centered at the UA extension campus in Sierra Vista, AZ. The college focuses on training the future workforce to be adaptable to the “4th Industrial Revolution,” or the convergence of human and machine teaming - which involves robotics, VR, and AR human integration. It also runs one of the nation’s top - if not the top - cyber intelligence operations programs through the Cyber Convergence Center, which partners with the local military community at Fort Huachuca to train the next generation of cyber professionals. The college also partners with the Sierra Vista Chamber of Commerce and is an economic driver within the community and keeps Sierra Vista growing.
