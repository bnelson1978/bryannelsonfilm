Climate change is personal to Arizona residents, and few know this better than University of Arizona climate scientist, Jessica Tierney. She is a lead author on the most recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, a United Nations body that is the world authority on our changing climate. This latest report is perhaps the starkest yet - laying out unequivocal evidence of the role that human activity plays in warming the planet. Tierney and her team examine what this might mean for Arizona, our life-giving monsoon season, and the ongoing drought.
