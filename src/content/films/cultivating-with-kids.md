The University of Arizona’s Community & School Garden program is an innovative educational platform that transforms gardens into STEM learning labs, connecting students and citizen scientists with Tucson’s 4,000-year agricultural legacy. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the program has become a leader in how to adapt to distant learning models, focusing on outdoor engagement and even producing YouTube field trips with charismatic hosts. The program is a sterling example of how gardens do more than just grow food; they can grow brains too.
