For this premiere episode of New Frontiers, we introduce host Erika Hamden, an astrophysicist at the University of Arizona who is working to become an astronaut; we get the latest updates on NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope from two of the scientists who helped construct its cameras; we visit with researchers who are building swarms of robots designed to colonize the moon.
