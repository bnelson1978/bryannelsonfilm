Traditionally, it’s been difficult for visually-impaired students to learn about aerospace engineering because understanding the mechanics of machine parts often requires being able to see how they move. But Dr. Kavan Hazeli, Associate Professor of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering at the University of Arizona, hopes to change that. He is using cutting-edge robotics, artificial intelligence, and augmented reality technologies to develop advanced educational tools that rely more on touch and sound. Together with roboticist and former pupil Sahand Sabet, Hazeli is testing prototypes of these educational tools with students from the Arizona State School of the Deaf and the Blind.
