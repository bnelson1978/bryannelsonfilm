Host Dr. Erika Hamden Ph.D, Professor of Astrophysics at the U of A, visits the University of Arizona’s Lunar and Planetary Laboratory to learn about recent missions to visit asteroids and views dust from asteroid Bennu which was recently brought to Earth by NASA’s OSIRIS-REx mission. Then, she meets with scientists from the SPACEWATCH program who use telescopes on Kitt Peak to scan our skies nightly for hazardous asteroids that might one day threaten our planet.
