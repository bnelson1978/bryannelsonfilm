Fictional storytelling is an important and pervasive part of how human cultures transmit knowledge and values across generations. But there are many philosophical questions that arise from this human act of fiction-making. For instance, what does it mean for a work of fiction — that is, a made-up story — to say something about what’s true?

Hannah H. Kim, a professor of Philosophy at the University of Arizona, argues that by examining questions like this, philosophy of fiction can help us better navigate a media landscape rife with misinformation, bots, and propaganda — and in doing so, teach us something about what it means to live a good life.
