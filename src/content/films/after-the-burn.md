In the aftermath of the Bighorn Fire in the Catalinas, researchers see a unique opportunity to better understand how fire impacts the delicate sky island ecosystems here in Arizona. How was this fire different from historical blazes? And what can we learn about nature's resiliency in the face of such cataclysmic events? We follow a research expedition led by fire and forest ecologist Don Falk and tree ring expert Laura Marshall to the high elevation forests atop Mt. Lemmon, to learn how this sensitive region has fared immediately following the blaze.
