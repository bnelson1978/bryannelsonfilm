A new service has been opened for free to the public thanks to University of Arizona libraries: the Wildcats Memory Lab. Here, people can bring their old media forms such as home videos on VHS, cassette tapes, vinyl, even floppy disks and other media forms, to be digitized. The project is led by Stacey Erdman, an associate faculty librarian who oversees both digital preservation and archival digitization for the library. It is funded thanks to a $43,240 grant from Arizona State Library, Archives & Public Records, a division of the Secretary of State, with federal funds from the Institute of Museum and Library Services.
