Back in 2009, the National Science Foundation funded the development of a network of so-called “critical zone observatories” around the U.S. intended to be environmental laboratories focused on the Earth’s outer skin - where water, atmosphere, soil, rock and ecosystems interact. The idea was to better understand the critical zones where life happens, from the top of the canopy down to the bedrock. The Catalina Mountains in Arizona were chosen as one of these key research locations, where University of Arizona scientists from different disciplines could bring their expertise together to better understand the complexity and dynamism of ecological systems.
