University of Arizona’s Center for Innovation, located at the UA Tech Park, has been chosen by the U.S. Department of Energy to be one of just six “Power Connectors”: sites ideally suited to serve as arenas for the American-Made Solar Prize, a national competition designed to energize U.S. solar manufacturing. It’s a grand opportunity for our region to attract innovators and cement itself as a worldwide economic hub for the development of solar technology - and to bring new forms of clean, renewable energy to our local electric grid.
