Professor Jeffrey Pyun and his team in the Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry at the University of Arizona have developed an advanced plastic made out of sulfur – a remarkable invention that makes use of a notoriously useless byproduct from the fossil fuel industry. Deemed the “Devil’s rock,” due to its association as brimstone, sulfur makes up 70 million tons of waste annually. Together with Robert Norwood, Professor of Optical Sciences at the University of Arizona, these new plastics have been developed into a variety of uses that include state-of-the-art infrared and night vision glasses, longer-lasting batteries for electric vehicles, and tires – among many more applications (including vinyl records!). In many cases, these sulfur-based plastics now rival traditional plastics in their application and use.
