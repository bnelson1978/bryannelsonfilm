FRESH (Food and Resources Expanded to Support Health) is an innovative project managed by the School of Nutritional Sciences and Wellness at the University of Arizona to provide medically tailored food boxes and educational support to food insecure individuals who have or are at risk of developing diet-related disease. The project partners with El Rio Health, the Community Food Bank of Southern Arizona, and Pivot Produce to supply and distribute the boxes to qualified patients. Currently in its second iteration, FRESH2 involves a year-long study to quantify the effectiveness of the program on patients’ long term health and how that might positively impact provider costs.
