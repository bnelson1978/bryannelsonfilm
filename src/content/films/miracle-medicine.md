Dr. Ski Chilton has dedicated his life to helping people around the world overcome health challenges to live more fulfilled and joyful lives, but he heralds his latest discovery as the most important thing he’s ever done. Chilton and his team at the University of Arizona believe they have discovered an enzyme that is at the very heart of COVID-19 mortality. His lab is now leading an international effort to develop an inhibitor to this enzyme that might drastically reduce the risk of severe disease. He hopes it could serve as a miracle medicine in places with low vaccination rates, like Africa.
