As one of the world’s top research institutions, the University of Arizona is taking the lead on the development of widespread antibody testing for the novel coronavirus. The effort, spearheaded by Dr. Janko Nikolich-Žugich and Dr. Deepta Bhattacharya, began as part of the university’s plan to safely re-open the campus amid the pandemic, but has now expanded to the state level and has become a benchmark for testing performance across the country. The endeavor is a testament to the ingenuity of Arizona scientists, to the remarkable research capacity of the university, and to the resiliency of the healthcare professionals who work on the front lines to administer this test statewide.
