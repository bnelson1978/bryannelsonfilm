The University of Arizona Sky School is an innovative educational program for students of all ages that integrates a wide variety of science and engineering disciples while fostering a deep connection to nature and a sense of place. Students travel up to the summit of Mt. Lemmon in the majestic Catalina Mountains and spend 1-3 nights doing field work around Steward Observatory’s Sky Center. While there, they can peer through telescopes, take tree core samples, and learn all about the ecosystems that surround them.
