The Event Horizon Telescope is a worldwide collaboration of radio telescopes that wowed the world in 2019 by taking the first images ever captured of a black hole. The monumental undertaking was spearheaded at the University of Arizona, which operates 3 of the telescopes in the array… one on Mt. Graham, one on Kitt Peak, and even one at the South Pole.

After that first image was released, the project set its sights on a much more personal target: the supermassive black hole suspected to reside at the center of our own galaxy, the Milky Way – called Sagittarius A star. And in May of 2022, the team officially released that much-anticipated image in an internationally-broadcasted press conference. The two images together provide the most precise tests yet for our theories of physics, and give tangible proof for black holes, the mysterious space anomalies once thought to be invisible.
