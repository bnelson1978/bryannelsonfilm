AzREADI, or the Arizona Rural EMS Advanced Telemedicine Demonstration Initiative, is an innovative new program to bring immediate lifesaving telemedicine access to remote areas of rural southern Arizona, such as the Sonoita-Elgin Fire District. Spearheaded by University of Arizona’s Department of Emergency Medicine, the program makes use of a specialized wireless network dedicated to first responders that can connect doctors with paramedics even if they are hours apart and located in regions otherwise devoid of cell service.
