On April 23, 2023, the iconic Steward Observatory dome on the University of Arizona campus celebrated its 100th birthday with a ribbon-cutting ceremony commemorating its original dedication in 1923. The observatory was built thanks to a donation from philanthropist Lavinia Steward, which was also the first major grant that the University had ever scored. Since then, the astronomy program at the University of Arizona has become one of the best in the world and hosts telescopes on mountaintops across the state and beyond. The University itself has grown up around the dome, but the original structure still stands as a testament to that storied history.
