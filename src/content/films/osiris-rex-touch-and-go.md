On October 20th, 2020, the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft unfurled its robotic arm and briefly touched one of the oldest objects in our solar system - the asteroid Bennu - and captured a sample of material to bring back to Earth. The moment was the pinnacle of this record-making mission, an example of the scientific ingenuity and engineering acumen of the team behind it at the University of Arizona... and we were there to capture every anxious and exhilarating moment as the event unfolded.
