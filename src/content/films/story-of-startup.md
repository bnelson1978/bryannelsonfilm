Thanks to the University of Arizona’s Center for Innovation and Tech Launch Arizona, Tucson is rapidly becoming a hub for technology startups. One example of this thriving business environment is the burgeoning company CarbeniumTec, which was founded by UA Chemistry Professor Thomas Gianetti and his postdoc Jules Moutet. The company, which is developing a battery for long-term energy storage for solar energy, is currently in the process of moving from its academic labs into a new base of operation at the UA Tech Park.
