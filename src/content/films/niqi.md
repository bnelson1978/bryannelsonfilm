Niqi Cavanaugh is a transgender ballet dancer who has faced many personal challenges, both in her internal struggle to self-identify and as a professional in an artistic medium that has traditionally placed a premium on defined gender roles and body form. Her journey to transcend gender norms and artistic convention is a testimony of self-affirmation, one which she has emerged from with an inspirational embrace for life.
