Christopher Hamilton, Associate Professor at the University of Arizona’s Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, is spearheading the RAVEN Project, a NASA-funded endeavor to develop the next generation of drones capable of exploring alien worlds like Mars. The project is currently testing prototypes over the Mars-like volcanic terrain of Iceland, and will follow in the footsteps of the Mars 2020 Mission – the first-ever demonstration of a rover-drone pairing on another planet, with the Perseverance rover and Ingenuity drone.
